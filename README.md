# svenvanewijk

Hello and welcome!

I'm Sven, starting Full Stack Developer mostly at home in everything JavaScript: Node.js, React.js, Express.js, and with a fondness of data/state management, think: Redux, Sequelize, GraphQL. 

My background is interdisciplinary. Debate is still out what that means, but one way to summarize it: Exact sciences are not enough. Not for me, and not for the problems we face as a society today. 

If you are curious about what I've been working on recently, you can find my recent work below here! If you want to know more about my background, have a look at my LinkedIn profile (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sven-van-ewijk/), or even better: contact me!
